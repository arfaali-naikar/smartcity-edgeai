## Features

- Real-time sensor monitoring (air, sound, motion, etc.)
- Lightweight ML models running on Raspberry Pi / Jetson Nano
- Secure communication to AWS/GCP (MQTT/REST)
- Cloud dashboards for historical analytics
- Dockerized microservices + CI/CD
- Built-in anomaly detection and alert system
